# Hello Phoenix

### Working through the Phoenix guides

The [Phoenix Guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html) are a very well written and well organized introduction to the framework. The guides provide an overview of the framework, [installation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) instructions, [learning](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/learning.html) resources, and places to connect with the [community](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/community.html).

After these prerequisite topics are covered and dependencies (including Elixir, Erlang, Hex, the Phoenix archive, PostgreSQL and node.js) are [installed](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html), the guides move on to building Phoenix apps. This repository has [branches](https://github.com/smeade/hellophoenix/branches/all) for each app-related topic in the guides. Each branch demonstrates concepts discussed in the guide for that topic. Most also have a demonstration app deployed to Heroku.

### How to use this

This repository is not a summary of the Phoenix guides nor a replacement for reading them. Read the Phoenix guides for information about each topic (see 'guide' links). Refer to this repository for example code ('src' links) and demo-applications ('demo' links) demonstrating the topic. Note that while Phoenix apps are very responsive, my demo apps are deployed to free Heroku dynos which go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. When you first click on a demo link, there will be a short delay while the dyno becomes active again.
