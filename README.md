# Hello Phoenix

### About

This repository has [branches](https://github.com/smeade/hellophoenix/branches/all) for each app-related topic in the Phoenix guides. Most topics also have a demonstration app deployed to Heroku.

### The guides

The [Phoenix Guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html) are a very well written and well organized introduction to the framework. The guides provide an overview of the framework, [installation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) instructions, [learning](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/learning.html) resources, and [community](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/community.html) links.

### How to use this

This is not a summary of the Phoenix guides nor a replacement for reading them. Read the Phoenix guides for information about each topic (see 'guide' links). Then refer to this repository for example code ('src' links) and demos ('demo' links).

While Phoenix apps are very responsive, these demo apps are deployed to free Heroku dynos which go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. When you first click on a demo link, there will be a short delay while the dyno reactivates.
